/*
This folder contains integration support files for Icebox Studio's Adventure Creator.

When you imported the Adventure Creator Support package, it also imported several files
into AdventureCreator/Scripts/Actions starting with ActionDialogueSystem* such as:

    ActionDialogueSystemBark.cs
    ActionDialogueSystemConversation.cs
    ActionDialogueSystemLua.cs
    ActionDialogueSystemRestoreData.cs
    ActionDialogueSystemSaveData.cs
        
Adventure Creator requires that these files are in its Actions folder. If you have
moved Adventure Creator from its default installation location, you *must* move
these files into the new location, too.

If you have any issues, please define these input settings in Unity's Input Manager:

    Mouse X
    Mouse Y
    Fire1
