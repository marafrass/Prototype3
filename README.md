# Prototype3 - Isle of Inlay

For my third prototype, I wanted to go a little deeper into the work I did for Snowdrift - this one is set on a more definable location, with less emphasis on location and more on dialogue. I used a series of assets and dialogue systems to try to create a world where the one and only gamified interaction is conversation.



For the prototype, I wanted to engage the player in a world where they are not wanted, and something strange is afoot. My testing questions mainly concern themselves with conversation and dialogue options, hence:

#### What questions do players care most about? Where is the line between frustration and deliberate vagueness in game narrative? What is the "Why can't I ask X" question, and when and how does it come up?

### 

(Further info on the prototype held back until playtests are over)

This prototype is intended to test player wants/wishes, rather than input and controls - both of which could use refining.



# Playtest Questions:

1. Did you have instances where you wanted to ask or say a certain thing, but couldn't? When, how often, and where did these instances come up? (Feel free to focus on this question!)
2. Did the attitude of the villagers make you curious? Did you begin putting together the story in your mind, based on hints and vague comments?
3. Did you feel like you were missing out on something?
4. Did you want to return to NPCs you spoke to earlier after learning new information? What would you have wanted to ask them?
5. Was there an NPC you were particularly curious about?
6. Are you doing okay? Is remote learning frustrating and tedious for you?
