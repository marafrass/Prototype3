# Prototype3 - Isle of Inlay

For my third prototype, I wanted to go deeper into the ideas I touched on with the work I did for Snowdrift - this one is set on a more definable location, with less emphasis on location and more on dialogue. I used a series of assets and dialogue systems to try to create a world where the one and only gamified interaction is conversation.



For the prototype, I wanted to engage the player in a world where they are not wanted, and something strange is afoot. My testing questions mainly concern themselves with conversation and dialogue options, hence:

#### What questions do players care most about? How ready is the player to form their own conclusions, and in a mystery setting, how proactive are they in looking for answers? What is the "Why can't I ask X" question, and when and how does it come up?

### 

This prototype is intended to test player wants/wishes, rather than input and controls - both of which could use refining.



# Playtest Questions:

1. Did you have instances where you wanted to ask or say a certain thing, but couldn't? When, how often, and where did these instances come up? (Feel free to focus on this question!)
2. Did the attitude of the villagers make you curious? Did you begin putting together the story in your mind, based on hints and vague comments?
3. Did you feel like you were missing out on something?
4. Did you want to return to NPCs you spoke to earlier after learning new information? What would you have wanted to ask them?
5. Was there an NPC you were particularly curious about?
6. Are you doing okay? Is remote learning frustrating and tedious for you?

# POST-PLAYTEST JOURNAL:
Firstly - I had no narrative or plot in mind when writing the dialogues. The idea was to create an omnious place to explore and let the player come to their own conclusions regarding what happened. That said, I think most playtesters inferred that the islanders were hostile and looking to kill any and all outsiders, as well as possibly the priest - I think that's a result of some too on-the-nose writing and some lines that gave a bit too clear of an idea of what that particular NPCs intent was.

As for actual results of the playtest, I had very mixed responses! Some mentioned wanting to avoid saying "too much" or becoming suspicious, while others noted that any probing questions from the player were shut down by NPCs. There were few instances where people mentioned wanting to ask or say any particular thing, leading me to believe that there's an aspect of RPG/basic video game literacy that the player is willing to assume; if I can't ask this, it's non-relevant or just doesn't really register - if it was important, it would be in the game to begin with. The solution to this, I think, is to allow a series of open questions, in varying degrees of "probey-ness", and instead place the difficulty and strategy of the player in what they should ask, and what they think would provide them with more anseers. The one instance where testers generally agreed was hoping to be able to return to the NPCs and talk to them about the subjects they discussed with other NPCs, which I agree should be added for a version of this game with a more coherent story, or at least one with a conclusion!

My biggest takeaway from the tests were that players in general enjoyed the mood and hostile atmosphere of the island - if I were to continue on with this prototype, that is where I would do the most changes and improvements. Possibly a lovecraftian mystery game, where you play as a detective and try to piece together what exactly is going on before it gets too late, and your hands are chopped off... or something less gruesome.
